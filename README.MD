# Hytale
hytale but on drugs is the best summery of this project i could think of. Its my first opengl game and it is showing me why graphic devs always sound depressed. this is giving me motivation to not learn vulkan and instead be a python skid :D :D :D

git clone https://github.com/bisher-almasri/hytale.git
